# META_CURRICULUM

This is a project that documents required information packages that could be used to organize arbitrary curriculum for integrative learning in the digital age. This differs from traditional curriculum since many online and offline digital content can be free and effective for personal and collective learning purposes. Therefore, even exisiting school systems could also leverage a meta-curriculum framework to reduce the unnecessary redundancy in their curriculum content development. More over, using tools such as Git, Github, and Mediawiki, a significant amount of content and relational pointers can be constantly updated and customized for a large number of participants. Therefore, this meta-curriculum could provide both an abstract framework to help organize content, and also provide concrente links to specific educational content that could be used immediately as the kernel of all liberal arts eduation. We also hope that this content could help guides individual students and school operators to design and implement learning programs that enables life-long learning. 

##Content Structure
The program would have a three-tiered layer struture to cover different aspects of concerns in learning.

* Macro-Scopic: The overall context of learning, from cultural backgrounds to socio-dynamics.
* Meso-Scopic: The combinatorial/compositional possibilities of macro-micro concern interactions
* Micro-Scopic: The domain-specific areas of experiential learning, focused on direct observation and reaction.

To make sure that this program is sound and complete, more importantly, that this course can evolve along the speedy changes of the surrounding world, the kernel of the program would be refined to be as small as possible. Therefore, we will guide students to learn a few tools that just covers their ability to become aware of the most basic ways of using data to represent space-time phenomonon. 

##Reference material
We will also leverage a number of curriculum and tips developed by some of the top educators around the world, and share their website, video-links, and other forms of publications. A few well-known website or personalities are listed below:

* Saraj Raval's Youtube Video: Saraj is this young educator, who has a large series of youtube content and meta-curriculum that could be leveraged for this curriculum development.
* Khan Academy: This is another interesting website that already has a multi-million followers and has a rather comprehensive set of learning content and interactive learning aides.
* edX, Udacity, and Cousera: These Massive Online Open Courseware (MOOC) websites are great sources of existing resources.
