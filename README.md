# META_CURRICULUM

This is a project that documents required information packages that could be used to organize arbitrary curriculum for integrative learning in the digital age. This differs from traditional curriculum since many online and offline digital content can be free and effective for personal and collective learning purposes. Therefore, even exisiting school systems could also leverage a meta-curriculum framework to reduce the unnecessary redundancy in their curriculum content development. More over, using tools such as Git, Github, and Mediawiki, a significant amount of content and relational pointers can be constantly updated and customized for a large number of participants. Therefore, this meta-curriculum could provide both an abstract framework to help organize content, and also provide concrente links to specific educational content that could be used immediately as the kernel of all liberal arts eduation. We also hope that this content could help guides individual students and school operators to design and implement learning programs that enables life-long learning.
