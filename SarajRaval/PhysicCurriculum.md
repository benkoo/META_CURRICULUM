I've compiled a 2 month Physics curriculum using free resources from across the Internet. Physics helped us build modern civilization. It's used extensively in computer engineering, quantum computing, and across many Scientific disciplines. Learning Physics helps hone your ability to think critically about the nature of reality, and this helps elevate your consciousness. In this video, I'll explain my curriculum and guide you through my process. Enjoy!
